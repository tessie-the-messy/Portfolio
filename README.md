Website for my portfolio as a Junior Web Developer

## Description

I created this web application with the intention of showcasing my work as a Junior Developer. Upon completion, it will be a great resource for potential employers to see my work firsthand, the website itself, and through the linked Projects that will be continually added throughout the class progression. As of now, it is in it's very early stages of development, with mostly filler information and images.

A complete website will be expected around January of 2023. Stay tuned!!
